For *large files* (like Ubuntu images) I use krusader_ to make backups or copy them somewhere on demand, but for *small, hand-written files* like configs, notes and scripts, I use bazaar_ (see below).

This way my stuff is

- versioned
- mirrored on three computers and
- accessible anywhere (well, the ssh port is open on most firewalls I have encountered so far).

Syncing desktop, notebook and server with bzr
=============================================
For projects like "studying", "wobsite", "evaluations", ... I use a bzr branch on my server like so::

    cd someproject
    # first time setup (on desktop)
    bzr init .
    bzr push sftp://server/var/bzr/someproject
    bzr bind sftp://server/var/bzr/someproject

    # get it to notebook (still on desktop)
    ssh notebook
        bzr co sftp://server/var/bzr/someproject
    exit

    # on the road, without internet access (on notebook)
    bzr unbind
    bzr m "will merge it, when i come home"

    # back at home, with internet access (on desktop)
    ssh notebook
        bzr bind
        bzr update
        bzr m "did some stuff on the road"
    exit

    cd someproject
    bzr update

Assuming ``~/someproject`` is already versioned and I have internet access available, the workflow remains simple::

    cd ~/someproject
    bzr update
    # do stuff
    bzr m "did stuff"
